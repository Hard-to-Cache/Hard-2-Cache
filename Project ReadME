# HardToCache: Automated Artifact Scoring Framework

## Project Overview
HardToCache is a reproducible science framework designed to automate the evaluation and scoring of scientific artifacts (research papers, datasets, and technical documents). This project addresses key challenges in research reproducibility by creating a standardized scoring system, automating data collection, and generating visual reports for transparent evaluation.

### Key Features
- 🖥️ **Integrated Web Dashboard**: Project website with embedded scorecard visualizations
- 📊 **Automated Scoring System**: Quantitative evaluation of research artifacts using predefined metrics
- 🤖 **Web Scraping Pipeline**: Automated data collection from scientific sources
- 🖨️ **Printable Poster Template**: Conference-ready visual summary of findings
- 🔄 **Reproducible Workflow**: Version-controlled automation via GitHub

## Reproducible Science Framework
Our solution enhances research reproducibility through:

   - Consistent scoring criteria across all artifacts
   - Transparent weighting system for quality assessment
   
2. **Automated Data Processing**
   - Web scraping pipeline for data collection
   - Automated scoring calculations
   - Version-controlled data transformations

3. **Visual Transparency**
   - Embedded scorecard visualizations in web and print formats
   - Publicly accessible evaluation methodology
   - Team bios and contribution tracking

4. **Open Workflow**
   - GitHub-based version control
   - Containerized execution environment
   - Complete documentation of methodology
