# HardToCache: Automated Artifact Scoring Framework

## Project Overview
HardToCache is a reproducible science framework that automates the evaluation and scoring of scientific artifacts (research papers, datasets, and technical documents). This project addresses key challenges in research reproducibility by creating a standardized scoring system, automating data collection, and generating visual reports for transparent evaluation.

### Key Features
- üñ•Ô∏è **Integrated Web Dashboard**: Project website with embedded scorecard visualizations
- üìä **Automated Scoring System**: Quantitative evaluation of research artifacts using predefined metrics
- ü§ñ **Web Scraping Pipeline**: Automated data collection from scientific sources
- üñ®Ô∏è **Printable Poster Template**: Conference-ready visual summary of findings
- üîÑ **Reproducible Workflow**: Version-controlled automation via GitHub

## Reproducible Science Framework
Our solution enhances research reproducibility through:

1. **Standardized Evaluation Metrics**
   - Consistent scoring criteria across all artifacts
   - Transparent weighting system for quality assessment
   
2. **Automated Data Processing**
   - Web scraping pipeline for data collection
   - Automated scoring calculations
   - Version-controlled data transformations

3. **Visual Transparency**
   - Embedded scorecard visualizations in web and print formats
   - Publicly accessible evaluation methodology
   - Team bios and contribution tracking

4. **Open Workflow**
   - GitHub-based version control
   - Containerized execution environment
   - Complete documentation of methodology

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for web scraping and data processing
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment for automation scripts
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for the project website
- **Terminal/Virtualenv**: Local development environment
- **Canva**: Poster design and visual layout
- **Google Docs/Sheets**: Collaborative content creation and scorecard metrics
- **PyMuPDF (PyPDF2)**: PDF processing and text extraction
- **SGX3 Project Server**: Secure environment for processing sensitive research data
- **HTML/CSS**: Website frontend implementation
